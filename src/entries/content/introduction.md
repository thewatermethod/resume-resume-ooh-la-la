I am a web developer with 10 years of experience. I have worked on many different platforms and parts of web applications. I have directed my focus on Javascript and accessibility, but I am proficient in all layers of the stack. I am enthusiastic and knowledgeable and looking for a new challenge in a creative and fast-paced environment.
