title: About Me
---

I'm been a web developer, software engineer, or webmaster for the last decade. I've worked in a variety of different industries, including ecommerce, education, and civic technology. Over the years, I've developed a passion for accessibility, problem solving, and building high quality user interfaces and web applications. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a professional, and make the most positive impact with my work that I possibly can.
