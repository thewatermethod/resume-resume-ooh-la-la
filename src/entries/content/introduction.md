I'm been a web developer, software engineer, or webmaster for the last decade. I've worked in a variety of different industries, including ecommerce, education, and civic technology. I have a passion for accessibility, problem solving, and building high quality user interfaces and web applications. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a professional and to make a positive impact with my work.
