I'm a web developer with nearly 10 years of experience. I've worked on as many different platforms and parts of web applications as I could get my hands on. I directed my focus on Javascript and accessibility, but I'm proficient in all layers of the stack. I'm enthusiastic and knowledgeable and looking for a new challenge in a creative and positive environment.
