-   Play an integral role in the migration of the college's external site from Sharepoint to Wordpress
-   Develop and maintain a plethora of custom themes and plugins for said Wordpress site
-   Spearhead adoption of version control (git) and Bitbucket for deployment
-   Take the lead on Web Accessibility, forever working towards complete compliance and accessibility for everyone
-   In a self-directed fashion, consistently work to improve developer ergonomics and performance
-   Lead the adoption of newer Javascript frameworks like Vue and React (the latter being a very important part of the Wordpress/internal user ecosystem)
-   Convert the Wordpress site's custom backend controls to use the new block based Gutenberg framework
-   Develop custom web solutions using the Microsoft Sharepoint API and React for our internal site
-   Aside from all that, I also built digital signage using Raspberry Pi's and Python Flask, migrated and supported a legacy academic webapp built in Laravel and Backbone, wrote serverless Azure functions in Python and in Node to support various other business needs, and I am always looking for a fun way to try something new and stretch my developer muscles.
