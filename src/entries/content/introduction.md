I'm a web developer with nearly 10 years of experience. I've worked on as many different platforms and parts of web applications as I could get my hands on, with a definite focus on Javascript and accessibility. I'm enthusiastic and knowledgeable and looking for a new challenge in a creative and positive environment.
