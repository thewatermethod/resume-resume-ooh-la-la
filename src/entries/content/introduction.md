Over the last ten plus years, I've been a web developer, software engineer, and webmaster. I've worked in a variety of different industries, including ecommerce, education, and civic technology. I have a passion for accessibility, problem solving, and building high quality user interfaces and web applications. I'm looking for new challenges to grow as a professional and to make a positive impact with my work.
